# Machine Learning Model for Titanic Dataset

This repository shows how to acheive from raw data to a machine learning model. This model is made to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model is built using various machine learning techniques and is trained on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.


## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes various features about the passengers such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Model
The model used in this project includes various machine learning algorithms such as <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>RandomForestClassifier</b>, and <b>XGBoost</b>. The best performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
